# Custom_CharacterBody_Movement_System
A fully custom made replacement for Godot 4's broken and useless "move_and_slide()" function. Was designed to imitate the source engine's character controller as closely as possible, with a few of my own tweaks and improvements.

To-do:
- Await Godot to fix physics detection bugs (see github) aka Figure out safe_margin annoyances
- Code cleanup?
- Swimming
- Climbing
- Stair Stepping
