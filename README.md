# Custom_CharacterBody_Movement_System
A fully custom made replacement for Godot 4's broken and useless "move_and_slide()" function.

To-do:
- Better snapping?
- Fix terrible collision detection on CSG geometry
- Fix corner collisions reporting floor normals on the floor normal check despite the collision occuring far above the player's feet
