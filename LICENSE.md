# License and Legal Stuff

Feel free to use this and learn from it, but considering the ungodly amount of time this took me (a total of 2 years from start to finish), I require credit in anything you use this in. Credit consists of including the following string in your project's credits:

> This project uses code created by Gamepro5 (http://gamepro5.com), namely for the 3D player controller.

Thanks for understanding!
